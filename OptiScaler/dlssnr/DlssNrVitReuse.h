// Reuse of the ViT bottleneck of NVIDIA's own DLSS-NR model.
//
// One NR evaluation launches its kernels on the game's command list through NvAPI. The ViT bottleneck (blocks 31-38, the
// coarsest and most stable level of the network) is one contiguous run of those launches, from cc_vit_1d_repack_2d_to_1d
// through cc_vit_1d_repack_1d_to_2d, and about a fifth of the evaluation. Leaving that run out on some frames leaves the
// previous frame's result in its output buffer, which the next kernel reads.
//
// Why dropping the run is safe (checked on a real capture, fp8 kernels): the run's sync counters are referenced by no kernel outside
// it, so nothing that is kept can wait on something that was dropped; and its output buffer is written only by its last kernel.
// Anything that does not look like that turns the feature off for the session instead of guessing.
//
// This header is only the decision: which launch of an evaluation is dropped. It knows nothing about NvAPI, so tests/nr_vit_reuse_smoke.cpp
// exercises it on the host.
