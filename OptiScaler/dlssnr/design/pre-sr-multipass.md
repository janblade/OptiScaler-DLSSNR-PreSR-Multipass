# Pre-SR placement and persistent multipass

This experimental branch adds two opt-in controls to the `[DlssNr]` section:

- `RunBeforeSR=true` runs Neural Rendering on the colour input immediately before Super Resolution.
  The default is `false`, preserving the v0.2.0 post-upscale seam. Originally Ray
  Reconstruction/DLSSD was forced to stay post-upscale; the v0.7.4 unification lifted that, and
  `RunBeforeSR` now applies to combined RR+SR too — see "Across-RR residual" below for why the
  naive combination is weak and what `ResidualAcrossRR` does about it.
- `Passes=N` selects one to three sequential model layers. The default is `1`.
- `Pass2Preset`, `Pass2Style`, `Pass3Preset`, and `Pass3Style` optionally select a different built-in
  profile for later layers. `auto` inherits pass 1. These are profiles inside one model runtime, not
  separate model DLLs.

## Multipass lifetime and data flow

Every layer owns a persistent NGX feature and temporal history. A missing feature is created in one
submission epoch and remains pending until that epoch changes; no Neural Rendering feature is
evaluated on the command-list recording that created it. Native DX12 uses the wrapped Present count,
while the DX11/Vulkan bridges supply their post-submit frame counter. At most one extra feature is
created per submitted frame. A failed extra creation is latched and the ready contiguous prefix
remains active, rather than reusing the main feature or retrying every frame.

Preset and style are read when a layer's feature is created. Pass 1 uses `Preset` and `Style`; later
passes inherit those values unless their override is set. Changing an active layer's profile parks the
whole generation for deferred release and rebuilds it through the same one-feature-per-submission
sequence. Changing an inactive layer does not disturb pass 1; its profile is read when that layer is
later enabled.

The frame is encoded once. Its base proxy remains immutable while model answers ping-pong through two
same-format, same-size resources:

`base -> A -> B -> A` (as needed for one, two, or three layers)

The final answer is composed once against the immutable base. This keeps matched-residual transfer
cumulative (`final - base`) without compounding colour/transfer settings. Local tone is applied by the
first model layer only. A camera cut resets every active layer; a newly created extra layer is also
reset on its first evaluation.

Features and scratch resources are parked for deferred release on tuning, raster, format, placement,
or pass-count changes so in-flight frame-generation work cannot retain freed objects.

## Resource-state rules

Post-SR output uses the existing output-arrival state. Pre-SR colour arrives and is returned as a
non-pixel shader resource. If Color has no UAV flag, composition writes to an owned scratch texture and
copies back instead of binding an illegal UAV.

## Guardrails

- Pass count is clamped to `1..3`; historical testing found later layers converged while cost and
  artifacts continued to grow.
- The driver-proxy backend remains single-pass and logs the effective fallback.
- Origin-zero padded or max-sized Color allocations are copied to an active-sized UAV texture before
  encode/model/resolve, then only the edited active rectangle is copied back. The game's padding and
  resource state are preserved. The compact texture shares the scratch set's deferred retirement;
  changes in active resolution rebuild NR features/history as usual. No shader or guide-coordinate
  resampling is introduced by the crop. The extra copies are inside NR's GPU timing interval.
- Non-zero colour offsets, partial/out-of-bounds active sizes and unsupported texture layouts still
  fall back post-SR. Both absent active-size values retain the resource-size interpretation.
- Placement is part of the rebuild key even when pre/post surfaces happen to share dimensions and
  format (for example DLAA).
- Working scales from 25% through 200% remain supported; the ping-pong resources use model-work size.

## Across-RR residual (`ResidualAcrossRR`, experimental)

The v0.7.4 NR unification let `RunBeforeSR` also apply to combined RR+SR. Running NR straight
before RR wastes most of its edit: NR's contribution is high-frequency and un-accumulated, and
RR's temporal denoiser removes exactly that. `ResidualAcrossRR=true` (only with `RunBeforeSR` +
the game's RR both active) works around it:

- The pre-SR seam runs the model but the resolve writes an owned scratch, not `DLSSD.Color`, so
  RR+SR see the frame untouched (`FinishColor(false)` skips the copy-back).
- The model's edit is `Δ = edited − original`. Its dominant term is `−n_t`, this frame's
  ray-trace noise; adding that raw onto RR's already-denoised output just re-injects the noise
  (an earlier additive prototype did exactly this and grain-flickered). `n_t` is temporally
  uncorrelated and averages to zero; the useful `enhancement_t` term follows geometry and
  persists. So a persistent render-res **enhancement layer** is kept, reprojected each frame by
  the game's motion vectors (mode 8 + `dlssnr_residual.hlsl` Accumulate) and blended with the
  new `Δ` at `ResidualAcrossRRBlend` (default `0.08`). Before the blend the reprojected history
  is clamped to `mean ± 1.5σ` of the current `Δ` over its 3×3 neighbourhood — a TAA-style
  neighbourhood clamp. Where the reprojection was tracking the geometry it does nothing; at a
  motion boundary it collapses the smear rather than carrying the old edit forward, and because
  it also pulls zero history into range it fills disocclusions (off-screen, non-finite MV)
  without the slow crawl. It is what lets the blend rate stay low without trailing. A camera cut
  (`Reset`) drops the layer entirely.
- The reprojection normalizes and samples the motion vectors the same way
  `DlssNr_DeferredSr`'s half-rate path does — at render size, 1:1 — so it requires
  **render-resolution, origin-aligned** motion (`MVLowRes`). A display-resolution or
  subrect-offset motion atlas would need the general resample the resolve path threads through
  `mvToWork`/guide bases; when the guides do not match, this run falls back to plain pre-SR NR
  (logged) instead of reprojecting with vectors that do not line up.
- The post-SR seam upscales the layer to output size and adds it onto the finished RR+SR frame
  (`dlssnr_residual.hlsl` Apply, scaled by `TransferStrength`; strength `0` is byte-identical).

`dlssnr_residual.hlsl` is a **separate blob and compute PSO** from `dlssnr.hlsl`, reusing this
class's root signature. It exists so the main NR shader — which every path depends on — is never
regenerated; a current `dxc` produces materially different DXIL from the committed
`DlssNr_Shader.cso`.

Known limits by construction: the enhancement still lags somewhat on fast motion (the clamp
bounds the smear, it does not erase the accumulator's latency), and view-dependent detail
(moving speculars) is smeared by the temporal mean. The ceiling is *complementary to* post-RR
NR, not better than it — pre-SR NR and RR are overlapping neural reconstructors. DX12 only, and
only where the game's motion vectors are render-resolution and origin-aligned; native Vulkan
wiring is a later change.
