# Self-Evolution Engine

## Overview

The evolution skill is the meta-skill — it enables the AI OS to improve itself.
Every self-modification flows through this skill, ensuring changes are proposed,
reviewed, verified, and logged according to the PDCA cycle.

## Dependencies

- `observability.sk` — Required for decision logging and audit trail

## Commands

### EVOLVE_PROPOSE

Propose a system evolution.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_PROPOSE --type=<type> --target=<target> --description=<desc>
```

**Types:** `skill_create`, `skill_update`, `command_create`, `command_update`, `workflow_optimization`, `memory_update`

**Procedure:**
1. Generate a unique evolution ID: `EP-{sequential_number}`
2. Validate the proposal:
   - Is the target in user space? (Kernel space → reject immediately)
   - Is `security.sk` being modified? (→ flag as requiring human approval)
   - Does the change violate any rules? (→ cross-reference `ultimate_rules.md`)
3. Assess risk level:
   - `low`: Memory updates, alias additions, non-critical workflow changes
   - `medium`: New skills, command updates, workflow structural changes
   - `high`: Security-adjacent changes, changes affecting multiple skills
4. Write proposal to `progress.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Evolution Proposal: EP-{n}
   - **Date**: {timestamp}
   - **Type**: {type}
   - **Target**: {target}
   - **What**: {description}
   - **Why**: {rationale}
   - **Risk**: {level}
   - **Rollback Plan**: {how to undo}
   - **Rules Check**: {confirmed no violations}
   - **Status**: PROPOSED
   ```
5. If low-risk and non-security → proceed to EVOLVE_APPLY automatically
6. If medium/high-risk → present to user and wait for approval

---

### EVOLVE_APPLY

Apply an approved evolution.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_APPLY --id=<EP-n>
```

**Procedure:**
1. Look up proposal by ID in `progress.md`
2. Verify status is PROPOSED or explicitly approved by user
3. **Preserve**: Save current state of affected files (for rollback)
4. **Apply**: Execute the evolution:
   - For `skill_create`: Create new `.sk/` directory with SKILL.md, update `registry/index.json`
   - For `skill_update`: Modify the target SKILL.md
   - For `command_create`/`command_update`: Update `commands/index.json`
   - For `workflow_optimization`: Update `memory/procedural/workflows.json`
   - For `memory_update`: Update target memory file
5. **Verify**: Run integrity check:
   - All affected files parse correctly
   - `registry/index.json` is consistent with disk
   - No rules are violated
   - If skill was modified: dry-test the skill
6. **If verification passes**:
   - Update proposal status to APPLIED
   - Log in `decisions.jsonl`
   - If the evolution was structural or architectural, update `memory/semantic/project_knowledge.md` to reflect the new system behavior
   - Increment `manifest.json.evolution_history.total_evolutions`
   - Update `manifest.json.evolution_history.last_evolution`
   - **Commit and push**: in this repo (MaiKS's own dev repo), finish by running `RELEASE`
     — the documented commit/push gate. In an installed project, follow the project's own
     VCS conventions; `RELEASE` is not shipped to installs.
7. **If verification fails**:
   - Restore preserved files
   - Update proposal status to ROLLED_BACK
   - Log failure in `decisions.jsonl`
   - Report to user

---

### EVOLVE_ROLLBACK

Revert a previously applied evolution.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_ROLLBACK --id=<EP-n>
```

**Procedure:**
1. Look up evolution by ID — must have status APPLIED
2. Restore preserved pre-evolution state
3. Run integrity check
4. Update status to ROLLED_BACK
5. Log rollback in `decisions.jsonl`
6. Report result

---

### EVOLVE_STATUS

Show evolution history and pending proposals.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_STATUS [--filter=proposed|applied|rolled_back|all]
```

**Procedure:**
1. Read `progress.md` for pending proposals
2. Read `decisions.jsonl` for evolution history
3. Display summary table: ID, Date, Type, Target, Status, Risk
4. Show statistics: total evolutions, success rate, last evolution

---

### EVOLVE_DIFF

Show the diff of a specific evolution.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_DIFF --id=<EP-n>
```

**Procedure:**
1. Look up evolution by ID
2. If preserved state exists: show diff between before/after
3. If no preserved state: show current content with annotation

---

### EVOLVE_BENCHMARK

Compare this framework against leading AI agent frameworks/practices; write genuine
capability gaps as new PROPOSED evolutions. On-demand only — invoked explicitly, never
run as part of `BOOT.md` §2. A boot-time competitive-research step would break the
"cheap by design" boot path every other step in §2 follows; this command exists precisely
so that cost is paid only when asked for.

```
> OS_COMMAND EVOLVE_BENCHMARK [--focus=<area>]
```

**Procedure:**
1. Read this framework's actual current state fresh — `registry/index.json`,
   `commands/index.json`, `rules/ultimate_rules.md`, `BOOT.md` — don't rely on
   recollection of a past read (R21).
2. Research comparison frameworks/practices. `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` available → use them,
   prefer sources with visible dates. Not available → rely on internal knowledge only, and
   label every finding as knowledge-cutoff-bounded, not verified current state — never
   present it as fact (R21).
3. Filter to genuine gaps:
   - Capability exists elsewhere, doesn't exist here.
   - Not a deliberate tradeoff this framework already reasoned through — check
     `progress.md`'s past EPs first; a gap already considered and rejected isn't
     re-proposed without new information (R8, e.g. don't re-propose "always show
     chain-of-thought" against `BOOT.md` §11's host-gated reasoning decision).
4. Each surviving gap → write a new `EP-{n}` to `progress.md` using `EVOLVE_PROPOSE`'s
   template, Status `PROPOSED`. Never auto-apply regardless of assessed risk level — an
   externally-sourced proposal always waits for explicit review, unlike an
   internally-verified low-risk change.
5. Report to the user: what was checked, what gaps were found (with confidence label per
   finding), what was excluded as already-considered.
6. Counts toward the standard 5-evolutions-per-conversation rate limit like any other
   batch of proposals.

### RELEASE

**Project-only** — specific to MaiKS's own dev repo, like `EVOLVE_BENCHMARK`. Its
registrations are stripped from fresh installs (`INSTALL_PROMPT.md` Step 4) and never
merged in on upgrade (`UPDATE_PROMPT.md` Step 3); an installed project commits its own
evolutions per its own VCS conventions, not this procedure. The commit/push gate for an
applied evolution in this repo — the documented tail of `EVOLVE_APPLY` step 6.

```
> OS_COMMAND RELEASE
```

**Procedure:**
1. **Scope.** Identify the evolution(s) APPLIED since the last push: `git log origin/main..HEAD`
   plus `progress.md` entries whose Status is `APPLIED` and whose files aren't yet in a
   pushed commit. Confirm the working tree contains only those EPs' intended files — a
   stray unrelated change → stop, surface it, don't sweep it into the release commit.
2. **CHECK sweep** (re-run `EVOLVE_APPLY`'s verify at release time, it's cheap):
   - every touched JSON parses;
   - `registry/index.json` ↔ `commands/index.json` consistent — the same skill's command
     list matches on both sides;
   - each EP's `progress.md` Status is `APPLIED` (not `PROPOSED`/`ROLLED_BACK`);
   - a `type: "evolution"` `decisions.jsonl` entry exists for each EP;
   - if an EP changed `.ai-os/` behaviour that `UPDATE_PROMPT.md` propagates, a
     `MIGRATIONS.md` section covers it (the newer-than-or-equal walk, EP-62);
   - `manifest.json.evolution_history.last_evolution` = the newest EP being released;
     `total_evolutions` incremented once per APPLIED EP that touched `.ai-os/` payload —
     an installer-doc-only or `README.md`-only EP consumes an EP-ID without bumping the
     counter (EP-45/47/62 precedent).
3. **Version.** Bump `manifest.json.ai_os_version` (and the README footer) **only if an EP
   explicitly calls for it.** Additive skill/command/memory content does not bump it
   (EP-43 / EP-58..61 precedent); a change to a kernel contract or anything that alters
   compatibility for an installed project does.
4. **Gate.** R9 clean-tree-before-self-modification (already satisfied if step 1 passed);
   R20 — never `--force`, hard-reset, or discard uncommitted work without explicit
   confirmation; `evolution_policy.md`'s 5-evolutions-per-conversation soft cap — if this
   release covers the 6th+ applied EP this conversation, pause and summarise first.
5. **Commit** — one commit per EP, message:
   `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (EP-NN)` where `<type>` matches the EP's Type
   (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`chore`/`refactor`), a brief what-and-why body, and the
   `Co-Authored-By:` trailer **the harness specifies for the current session** — the model
   name in it varies by session, never hardcode one.
6. **Push** — `git push origin main`. This repo commits straight to `main`, no PR (its
   `progress.md`/`decisions.jsonl` are its changelog). Report the pushed SHA(s).

Does **not** touch semantic memory — promotion stays with `TASK_CLOSE`/`MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE`.

## Stack Drift & Gap Resolution Protocol

When a `stack-drift` event is flagged during Boot Phase 3:
1. **Analyze Gaps**: Compare new technologies in the `tech_stack` with current capabilities in `registry/index.json` and `commands/index.json`.
2. **Draft Proposal**:
   - If a new language is added: propose adapting or adding testing and formatting commands.
   - If a new framework is added: propose scaffold templates or playbooks.
3. **Execute EPs**:
   - If archetype is `hobby` or `startup`: auto-scaffold skill adjustments (e.g. adding a test suite subcommand or pattern template for the new language).
   - If `enterprise` or `critical`: present the EPs to the user for review.
4. **Log Results**: Log the gap and resolution in `decisions.jsonl` and update `progress.md`.

## Rate Limiting

Per `evolution_policy.md`:
- Maximum **5 evolutions per session** without explicit user acknowledgment
- Track evolution count in session state
- After limit: pause and summarize all changes, wait for user to continue

## Common Mistakes

1. **Evolving without proposing** — Always create a proposal first, even for small changes.
2. **Not preserving state** — Always save the pre-evolution state for rollback capability.
3. **Batch evolving** — Apply evolutions one at a time. Verify each before the next.
